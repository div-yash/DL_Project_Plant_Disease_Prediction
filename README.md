# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Prediction using Deep Learning

This project is a **Plant Disease Prediction System** built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and deployed with **Streamlit**.  
It predicts whether a plant leaf is healthy or infected with a particular disease by analyzing the uploaded image.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Deep Learning model (CNN) trained on plant leaf dataset.  
- Predicts disease class from uploaded images.  
- Image preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalization).  
- Interactive **Streamlit Web App** for easy use.
